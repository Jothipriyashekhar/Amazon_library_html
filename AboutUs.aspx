    <h4><b>Our Vision</b></h4>
        We envision a world where enduring, abundant, equitable, and meaningful access to information serves to empower and inspire humanity.
        <h4><b>Our Mission</b></h4>
        The Amazon Libraries aspires to advance knowledge by providing a trusted foundation for the generation, dissemination, use, creative engagement with, and preservation of information, in support of the MIT mission and so that it can be brought to bear on the world’s great challenges and in the cause of social justice.
    <h4><b>Our Values</b></h4>
        How we pursue our mission is as important as the mission itself, thus our organization supports the core values of both the profession of librarianship and our parent institution, MIT. Our values ground both our strategic decisions and our operational approach: we aim to do great things, and to find joy and meaning in our work.
